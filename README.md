# Javascript Play Ground

#### Author: David Couch
#### This is an app designed to simply display text to your web page from the scripts.js files. 

* * *

## Description  
This app uses innerHTML to display return values in plain text to negate having to go to the console every time you want to test a line of code.
* * *


## Technologies used
* HTML
* CSS
* Git and Github
* JavaScript
* * *

## Setup instructions:  
* Got to ( https://github.com/dcouch440/javascript-pg.git )
*  Navigate to the code button on the github website.\

- Copy the HTTPS code by clicking the clipboard next to the link.

- Within your Bash terminal navigate to your desired location by using cd fallowed by your desired directory.
```bash
 cd Desktop
``` 

- Once you have chosen your desired directory use the command.
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/dcouch440/javascript-pg.git
```

<div 
  style="
    background-color: #d1ecf1; 
    color: grey; padding: 6px; 
    font-size: 9px; 
    border-radius: 5px; 
    border: 1px solid #d4ecf1; 
    margin-bottom: 12px"
> 
  <span 
    style="
      font-size: 12px; 
      font-weight: 600; 
      color: #0c5460;"
  >
    â“˜
  </span>
  <span 
    style="
      font-size: 12px; 
      font-weight: 900; 
      color: #0c5460;
      margin-bottom: 24px"
  >
    Note : 
  </span> 
  If you have any problems make sure your HTTPS code is correct! The example above might not be the most recent HTTPS code!
</div>


* Then after the process is completed use the command.

``` bash
code .
```
* This will open the directory in your default code editor and from there it is required that you open the index.html file from live server (Visual Studio Code) or your code editors counterpart. You <strong>must</strong> use this method. Opening this web app from the index.html file alone will cause it to not function correctly!

<p 
  style="
    font-size: 12px; 
    background-color: #8c8c8c; 
    border-radius: 2px; 
    padding: 1px 5px; 
    text-align: center; 
    color: white; 
    margin-bottom: 24px"

  <span style="font-weight: 700; color: purple">Live server</span>
